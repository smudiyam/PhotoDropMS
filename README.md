# PhotoDropMS 
# Developer : Sumanth Mudiyam
It is an android application that allows a user to authenticate with their Dropbox credentials and take a photo and uploads it to a directory on their Dropbox account and lists all photos that have been uploaded to that directory and view selected photos.

This project is developed with good code quality and organisation. It handles negative cases pretty well like session creation and termination, closing the activities properly, handles well when there are no photos to display and few other cases. Photo list is displayed as custom listview for good look and easy selection. Most of the times, AsyncTasks have been used to avoid burden on UI/Main Thread , thus it improves performance very much. This is a complete working android application and well tested.
